        The leaves have a green pigment
        called <b>chlorophyll</b>. It helps leaves to
        capture the energy of the sunlight. This
        energy is used to synthesise (prepare)
        food from carbon dioxide and water.
        Since the synthesis of food occurs in the
        presence of sunlight, it is called
        <img align="right" src="images/photosynthsis.jpg" alt="photosynthesis" width="500" height="500">
        <b>photosynthesis</b> (Photo: light; synthesis :
        to combine). So we find that chlorophyll,
        sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are
        necessary to carry out the process of
        photosynthesis. It is a unique process
        on the earth. The solar energy is
        captured by the leaves and stored in the
        plant in the form of food. <b>Thus, sun is
            the ultimate source of energy for all
            living organisms</b>.In the absence of photosynthesis
        there would not be any food. The
        survival of almost all living organisms
        directly or indirectly depends upon the
        food made by the plants. Besides,
        oxygen which is essential for the survival of all organisms is produced during
        photosynthesis. In the absence of
        photosynthesis, life would be impossible
        on the earth.
        During photosynthesis, chlorophyll
        containing cells of leaves, in
        the presence of sunlight, use carbon
        dioxide and water to synthesise
        carbohydrates (Fig. 1.3).During the process oxygen is
        released. The presence of starch in
        leaves indicates the occurrence of
        photosynthesis. Starch is also a
        carbohydrate.

    <h1 class="subHeader">MODES OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS </h1>
    <p class="leftTxt">
        The mode of
        nutrition in which organisms make food
        themselves from simple substances is
        called <b>autotrophic</b> (auto = self; trophos
        = nourishment) nutrition. Therefore,
        plants are called <b>autotrophs</b>. Animals
        and most other organisms take in food
        prepared by plants. They are called
        <b>heterotrophs</b> (heteros = other).
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some plants which do not have
        chlorophyll. They cannot synthesise
        food.They use the <b>heterotrophic mode</b>
        <img align="right" src="images/cusscuta.png" alt="cusscuta tree" width="350" height="350">
        of nutrition.Do
        you see a yellow wiry branched structure
        twining around the stem and branches
        of a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta
        (Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll.
        It takes readymade food from the plant
        on which it is climbing. The plant on
        which it climbs is called the <b>host</b>.
        Since
        it deprives the host of valuable nutrients,
        Cuscuta is called the parasite.

        There are a few plants
        which can trap insects and digest them.
        Look at
        the plant in Fig. 1.6. The pitcher-like or
        <img align="left" src="images/pitcherPlant.png" width="350" height="300">
        jug-like structure is the modified part
        of leaf. The apex of the leaf forms a lid
        which can open and close the mouth of
        the pitcher. Inside the pitcher there are
        hair which are directed downwards.
        When an insect lands in the pitcher, the
        lid closes and the trapped insect gets
        entangled into the hair. The lid closes
        and the insect is trapped. The insect is
        digested by the digestive juices secreted
        in the pitcher and its nutrients are
        absorbed. Such insect-eating plants are
        called insectivorous plants.

            Take a piece of bread and moisten it with
            water. Leave it in a moist warm place
            for 2 to 3 days or until fluffy patches
            appear on them (Fig. 1.8). What is the
            colour of these patches? Observe the
            patches under a microscope or a
            magnifying glass. Write down your
            observations in the notebook. You will
            see cotton-like threads spread on the
            piece of bread.These organisms are called <b>fungi</b>.
            They have a different mode of nutrition.
            They absorb the nutrients from the
            bread. This mode of nutrition in which
            organisms take in nutrients from dead
            and decaying matter is called
            <b>saprotrophic nutrition</b>. Such organisms
            with saprotrophic mode of nutrition are
            called <b>saprotrophs</b>.

        Some organisms live together and
        share both shelter and nutrients. This
        relationship is called <b>symbiosis</b>. For
        example, certain fungi live inside the
        roots of plants. The plants provide
        nutrients to the fungus and, in return,
        the fungus provides water and certain
        nutrients.
    </p>
    <p>
        In organisms called <b>lichens</b>, a
        chlorophyll-containing partner, which is
        an alga, and a fungus live together. The
        fungus provides shelter, water and
        minerals to the alga and, in return, the
        alga prepares and provides food to the
        fungus.
